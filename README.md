## 🐛 The 7 Bugs

There are **7 intentional bugs** in this codebase across different components:

### Foundational Bugs (Find These First)

| Bug   | Component   | Severity | Location                       | Hint                      |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **A** | Payment API | Medium   | `src/routes/payment.routes.js` | Check response data types |
| **B** | Payment API | High     | `src/routes/payment.routes.js` | Try €999,999,999          |
| **C** | Auth API    | Medium   | `src/routes/auth.routes.js`    | Try `user@domain`         |

### Advanced Bugs (For Strong Candidates)

| Bug   | Component    | Severity | Location                           | Hint                             |
| ----- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **D** | Webhooks     | Critical | `src/routes/webhook.routes.js`     | Security: signature verification |
| **E** | Webhooks     | High     | `src/routes/webhook.routes.js`     | What if webhook arrives twice?   |
| **F** | Table Orders | Medium   | `src/routes/table-order.routes.js` | Duplicate table orders           |
| **G** | E-Invoice    | Medium   | `src/routes/einvoice.routes.js`    | Duplicate submissions            |

## ✅ Your Tasks

### Task 1: Bug Hunting (1.5 hours)

Test the API systematically and find all 7 bugs.

**Minimum Requirements:**

- Find at least **5 out of 7 bugs** (Bugs A-E are must-find)
- Test with Postman/curl — don't just read code
- Document each bug with reproduction steps

**Testing Approach:**

1. **Happy Path Testing** — Test normal flows
2. **Negative Testing** — Invalid inputs, missing fields
3. **Security Testing** — SQL injection, XSS, signature spoofing
4. **Edge Case Testing** — Zero amounts, huge numbers, special characters
5. **Concurrency Testing** — Duplicate webhooks, simultaneous orders
6. **Integration Testing** — Webhook → Payment status update flow

**Deliverable:** `bug-reports.md`

**Format:**

```markdown
## Bug A: [Brief Title]

**Location:** src/routes/[file].js (approx line X)  
**Severity:** Critical / High / Medium / Low  
**Component:** Payment API / Webhooks / Table Orders / E-Invoice / Auth

**How to Reproduce:**

1. Start server: `npm start`
2. Login: `POST /api/auth/login` with `{"email":"merchant@test.com","password":"Test123!"}`
3. Send request: `GET /api/payments` with JWT token
4. Observe response...

**Expected Behavior:**
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior:**
[What actually happens - be specific]

**Impact:**
[Why this is a problem in production]

**Root Cause:**
[Your technical analysis - which line, what's wrong]

**Suggested Fix:**
[Brief code-level suggestion]
```

---

### Task 2: Bug Fixing (2 hours)

Fix all bugs you found with production-quality code.

**Requirements:**

- Fix at least **5 bugs** (all required)
- Code must be clean and maintainable
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments explaining your fix
- No breaking changes to API contracts

**Deliverable:** Fixed code files + `fixes.md`

**Format:**

```markdown
## Fix 1: Payment Amount Data Type

**Bug:** Amount returned as string instead of number

**Files Changed:**

- src/routes/payment.routes.js (lines 18, 41)

**Code Changes:**
\`\`\`diff

- amount: p.amount.toString(),

* amount: parseFloat(p.amount),
  \`\`\`

**Why This Fix:**
Frontend JavaScript calculations require numeric types. Strings cause
NaN errors and incorrect math operations. parseFloat() maintains
precision for currency values.

**Testing:**
\`\`\`bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payments

# Response: amount is now numeric type

\`\`\`
```

---

### Task 3: Test Writing (1.5 hours)

Write comprehensive tests to prevent these bugs from recurring.

**Requirements:**

- Minimum **10 tests** covering all 7 bugs
- Use Node.js built-in test runner (already configured)
- Tests must be runnable with `npm test`
- Cover happy path, negative cases, and edge cases

**Test Files:**

```
src/routes/__tests__/auth.routes.test.js
src/routes/__tests__/payment.routes.test.js
src/routes/__tests__/webhook.routes.test.js
src/routes/__tests__/table-order.routes.test.js
src/routes/__tests__/einvoice.routes.test.js
```

**Example Test:**

```javascript
import { test } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert";

test("Bug A: GET /payments should return amount as number", async () => {
  // Arrange
  const token = await loginAndGetToken();

  // Act
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/payments", {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
  });
  const data = await response.json();

  // Assert
  assert.strictEqual(response.status, 200);
  assert.strictEqual(typeof data.data[0].amount, "number");
  assert.strictEqual(data.data[0].amount, 25.5);
});

test("Bug B: POST /payments should reject amount over €50,000", async () => {
  const token = await loginAndGetToken();

  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/payments", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: 999999,
      currency: "EUR",
      customer_email: "test@test.com",
    }),
  });

  assert.strictEqual(response.status, 400);
  const data = await response.json();
  assert.ok(data.error.includes("maximum"));
});
```

**Run tests:**

```bash
npm test
```

---

### Task 4: Test Plan Document (30 minutes)

Write a comprehensive test plan for the **Webhook Payment Flow**.

**Deliverable:** `test-plan.md`

**Include:**

**1. Test Scope**

- What will be tested (payment webhook flow end-to-end)
- What won't be tested (UI, performance, load testing)

**2. Test Environment**

- API: localhost:3000
- Webhook simulator: curl/Postman
- Database: In-memory (resets on restart)

**3. Test Scenarios** (minimum 12):

- ✅ Valid webhook with correct signature
- ✅ Webhook with invalid signature (should reject)
- ✅ Duplicate webhook (same event_id twice)
- ✅ Webhook for non-existent payment
- ✅ Webhook arrives before payment created
- ✅ Multiple webhooks for same payment (different statuses)
- ✅ Webhook with missing fields
- ✅ Webhook with malformed JSON
- ✅ Concurrent webhooks (race condition)
- ✅ Webhook with SQL injection attempt in payment_id
- ✅ Webhook signature timing attack
- ✅ Webhook replay attack (old event_id)

**4. Security Tests**

- Signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
- Replay attack prevention
- SQL injection in webhook payload
- XSS in status field

**5. Edge Cases**

- Very large payment_id
- Unicode characters in status
- Null/empty event_id
- Future timestamps

**6. Integration Tests**

- Webhook → Payment status update → Database persistence
- Webhook → Socket.IO event emission
- Failed webhook → Retry logic (if implemented)

**7. Risk Assessment**

- What could go wrong in production?
- How would you detect it?
- How would you mitigate it?

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do This ✅

- **Actually test the API** — Use Postman/curl, don't just read code
- **Think like an attacker** — Test security vulnerabilities
- **Test edge cases** — What breaks it?
- **Write clear docs** — We evaluate communication skills
- **Test your fixes** — Run `npm test` before submitting
- **Follow existing patterns** — Match the codebase style

### Don't Do This ❌

- ❌ Only test happy paths — We want edge cases and security tests
- ❌ Just read code — Actually run the API and test it
- ❌ Skip the tests — We want to see you can write them
- ❌ Copy-paste fixes from AI without understanding
- ❌ Take more than 8 hours — If stuck, submit what you have
- ❌ Change API contracts — Keep existing endpoint behavior

---

## 🔧 Testing Tools

### Postman Collection

Import `postman-collection.json` for pre-configured requests.

### curl Examples

**Register:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@merchant.com","password":"SecurePass123!","business_name":"Test Co"}'
```

**Login:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"merchant@test.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

**Get Payments (with JWT):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Test Webhook:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/payment-status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-webhook-signature: fake-signature" \
  -d '{"payment_id":"1","status":"completed","event_id":"evt_123"}'
```

**Test Socket.IO:**
Use [Socket.IO Client Tool](https://amritb.github.io/socketio-client-tool/) or write a simple HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.socket.io/4.7.2/socket.io.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const socket = io("http://localhost:3000");
  socket.emit("join_table", 5);
  socket.on("order_status_changed", (data) => console.log(data));
</script>
```
